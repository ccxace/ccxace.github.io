        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Hey! We are a group of selective school students who have joined for one common mission – to provide quality tutoring at an affordable price. We believe it is human nature to be wanting to know more people, and in this case, we are your tutors! Therefore, let’s talk a bit about us.
            On the left picture, are our 2 VCE and selective-entry tutors, Ash and Shreyas. They both got accepted into Melbourne High School and John Monash Science School with 5 superiors, picked John Monash to pursue science in more thorough detail. On the right, are our 2 selective entry tutors, twins – Raghav and Madhav; much alike Ash and Shreyas, they also got accepted into Melbourne High School very recently. In terms of personality, many people have described them as relaxed, outgoing, adaptive, empathetic and most importantly, eager to navigate through a problem from many directions. We quote them : “We would love to know you better and offer some more insights into our character in a call!” Book it here
            Our tutors have participated in many debates, elocutions, talent research examinations. From securing a gold medal in National Science Olympiad to winning best candidate in debating finals at state level, we pride ourselves on the diligence, work ethic and modesty of our tutors. Apart from these achievements, our tutors actually have very similar hobbies :-
            Bird watching
            Reading medical journals
            Writing
            and most importantly sharing knowledge!
            We operate at a very-low cost, our main goal is not to make profit but to cherish the art of teaching. The money we charge only covers the time we have invested into obtaining the latest question banks and some research into the advanced methods of study.
            So why did we start tutoring? Well, it so happened that during preparation for the VCE SACS/Exams as well as the Selective Entry Exam, we observed thousands of people spending thousands of dollars. Now, that was not the appalling part alone, it was primarily how so many people spent so much money, just to be yet uncertain about their prospects of a good subject study score or entry into selective schools.
            So we asked ourselves, is there a better way? Life doesn’t give answers; we have to go out and explore. And then began the zealous quest to research cost-effective, efficient methods to distribute this, we need to make study about wanting to know more rather than just score more.
            In 2022, something incidental took place. Ash and Shreyas met Raghav and Madhav when they were preparing for their VCE Exams and the latter for their selective entry. It was this time when they discovered they shared great reasoning, passion for explaining and studying, doing their part to modify and improve what already exists. And hence, the seeds for Ventus Education were sown, their passions ignited, hard-work crystallised.
            And since then, we have only grown more eager to share our knowledge for a low cost with a level of efficiency you have never seen before. It’s a guarantee, and it isn’t a race, it’s a journey. Come along and you will not regret it!
